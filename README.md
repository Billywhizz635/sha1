# SHA-1
It's everybody's favourite NSA-approved hashing algorithm, now implemented for the (hundred-and-) first time in python!

## How to use
`python sha1.py`  
or, if you prefer, load it into your favourite IDE and run it from there!

## Possible extensions
Currently, this program only hashes strings, not actual files. So if I were to continue working on this, that's what I'd do.
